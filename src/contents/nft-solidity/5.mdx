## About this lesson

Congratulations on making it to this final tutorial in a series on smart contract
development of the ERC-721 standard, a.k.a. NFTs. In the first in the track, you created a basic smart
contract using Remix. Then a shift to a dedicated developer's environment to create and deploy an NFT
contract to an actual test network. In lesson 3 you added tiers to your NFTs, finally learning to make
your contracts air-tight by building your own automated testing suite in the fourth of the series.

But to create a full stack decentralised application, we also need a
UI, or front-end for users to interact with. In this lesson that is exactly what
we're going to create.

{/* We may as well comment out the following paragraph for this first PR of July/August 2023, since without any quizzes, it's not yet relevant: */}
{/* You can expect our familiar checkpoint questions throughout the tutorial for testing your previous knowledge, how well you‚Äôre picking up the new material, and even some on predicting upcoming steps in the lesson. They all help with critical thinking and active engagement. You'll find the updated code in side-drawers too as you progress, handy for identifying any pesky syntax errors you might come across. And of course, there is a final quiz waiting for you on completion. */}

Expect somewhere from one to four hours to complete the lesson, depending on your
prior experience and the need to grasp new concepts. We encourage you to maintain a
steady pace and encourage breaks for rejuvenation. So remind yourself to "go touch grass" and appreciate
nature's role in enhancing our well-being. üå± Relish your journey in development
in a good state of mind and body.

## What are we building

Now we're going use all of this knowledge and create a basic **NFT minting application**
that displays the three tiers of NFTs created in our smart contract and gives users
a one-click option to mint them. Once minted, users will be redirected to a page
that displays information of their mint. We'll need some extra magic to make that
all happen.

For handling wallet connections to our application, we'll be introducing you to _RainbowKit_.
And using the provided _hooks_ from _WAGMI_, we can check the connection to the
wallet and call functions from our smart contract through the front-end.
RainbowKit and WAGMI are just another couple of shining examples of open source
public goods. We love open source at Developer DAO. And public goods are gooood!

## Let's breakdown the lesson

{/* We could do with a oneliner for each to  describe what index.tsx and _app.tsx are for */}

- Set up our development environment with TierNFT project
- Create main application with Next.js, RainbowKit and WAGMI
  {/* - "a main entry point for displaying ..." needs a clearer definition */}
- Create an Index page as main entry point for displaying the app content
- Create NFT cards
- Enable minting of NFTs in the application
- Lesson Summary

## Tools to get the job done

- [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction) - a React library
  for out-of-the-box wallet management
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - a React framework for building a full-stack
  app
- [viem](https://viem.sh/docs/getting-started.html) - a compact JavaScript
  library for interacting with the Ethereum eco-system
- [WAGMI](https://1.x.wagmi.sh/) is a collection of React hooks that allows us to
  work effectively with Ethereum. We're using v1.
- [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) is an RPC provider that lets our app
  connect to the blockchain
- [WalletConnect](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in) - is a bridge that
  connects Decentralized Applications (DApps) to your web3 wallet

\* _always make sure you access up-to-date release notes and documentation_

Let's dive in!

<br />

## Getting started

We're going to start where we left off in _Write Automated Tests for your
TierNFT_.

Open your code editor and `cd` into the **`tierNFT`** project directory. For all
things related to our front-end we are going to create a new sub-directory
within our project's root directory to maintain good practice, keep our code
clean, and be easy to locate and read. The first step is to initiate a _Next.js_
application.

<Callout emoji="üí°">
  Make sure you are in your project's root directory before continuing.
</Callout>

The next command creates a sub-directory named `frontend` inside our root
directory and sets up all the necessary files and folders within it:

First switch to the root directory of your project. For example:

```bash
cd /d_d_academy/tierNFT
```

```bash
# use the RainbowKit starter to create our your Next.js application with RainbowKit
npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@0.2.11 --force
```

All you'll need to do is type the name of your project, which is `frontend`:

```bash
üåà Welcome to RainbowKit!

‚úî What is the name of your project? ‚Ä¶ frontend

üöÄ Creating a new RainbowKit app in ((path)):/d_d_academy/tierNFT/frontend
```

When this command finishes running you'll see:

```bash
üåà Done! Thanks for using RainbowKit üôè
```

Once the setup is complete, we open the `frontend` directory and get cracking.

```bash
cd frontend
```

<Callout emoji="üí°">
  Bug fix: You'll need to manually edit `frontend/package.json` and change
  `"@rainbow-me/rainbowkit": "^2.0.0",` to `"@rainbow-me/rainbowkit":
  "^1.0.0",`. This lesson is based on RainbowKit 1.x.
</Callout>

Try running the site:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You'll see a message that says which url to view your site at. It should say <strong>http://localhost:3000</strong>. Open that url in your browser to see if everything is working as expected. We'll be grabbing a valid projectID shortly.

<br />

## The Front-end

For users to easily interact with our smart contract and mint the NFTs we must
provide an interface. A simple process that is easily accessible. Let's start by
creating a way to handle wallet connections.

### The Main Application

RainbowKit and its dependencies are already installed and ready-to-go.

To get this setup we need to start working on the `pages/_app.tsx` file in the
`/frontend/pages` directory. The file should look something like this from our
initial setup:

```tsx
import "../styles/globals.css";
import "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css";
import { getDefaultWallets, RainbowKitProvider } from "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { configureChains, createConfig, WagmiConfig } from "wagmi";
import {
  arbitrum,
  goerli,
  mainnet,
  optimism,
  polygon,
  base,
  zora,
} from "wagmi/chains";
import { publicProvider } from "wagmi/providers/public";

const { chains, publicClient, webSocketPublicClient } = configureChains(
  [
    mainnet,
    polygon,
    optimism,
    arbitrum,
    base,
    zora,
    ...(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS === "true" ? [goerli] : []),
  ],
  [publicProvider()],
);

const { connectors } = getDefaultWallets({
  appName: "RainbowKit App",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  chains,
});

const wagmiConfig = createConfig({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors,
  publicClient,
  webSocketPublicClient,
});

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <WagmiConfig config={wagmiConfig}>
      <RainbowKitProvider chains={chains}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </RainbowKitProvider>
    </WagmiConfig>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

- `import '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css';` gives us some basic styling from
  Rainbowkit.
- `import { getDefaultWallets, RainbowKitProvider, } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';`
  returns the default wallet provider option and a RainbowKit Provider to "wrap"
  around our app so that we can use its features throughout the app's pages and
  components.
- `import { configureChains, createConfig, WagmiConfig } from "wagmi";`
  provides a way to configure the WagmiConfig wrapper for our app based on the
  chains and providers of our choice along with some other customisations.
- `import { alchemyProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/alchemy';` and
  `import { publicProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/public';` give us the
  provider configs for the providers we will be using. In our app we are using
  an `alchemyProvider` along with a fall back `publicProvider`. A provider
  allows our application to communicate with a blockchain.

Next we'll be configuring our application.

We save our configuration in a file called `.env` in the root of our `frontend` directory.

Create a new `.env.local` file with this content, and we'll be filling it in with real content next.

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS=true
```

Add your `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_ID`. This is your API Key from Alchemy.

Our dApp is also using WalletConnect, so we need a `projectID`
from the [WalletConnectCloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in).
So go and set up an account and grab that ID. You'll be done in a few minutes ü§ó

For this application we will continue using the `amoy` Polygon testnet. Other chains
can be added simply using the following syntax: `chain.chain_name`. For custom
providers, like the `alchemyProvider` we can pass in our private `apiKey` as
well.

Lastly add your `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` which is the address of your deployed contract on Amoy testnet.

Now we need to add these new environment variables to our codebase.

In `_app.tsx` Replace `projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',` with `projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID || "",`.

We're going to continue to use Alchemy as our provider for connecting to `amoy` testnet.

Please make these changes to `_app.tsx`:

- replace `import { publicProvider } from "wagmi/providers/public";` with `import { alchemyProvider } from "wagmi/providers/alchemy";` at the top of the file.
- in `configureChains` section, replace `[publicProvider()]` with `[alchemyProvider({ apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_ID || "" })]`.
- remove `zora` from `wagmi/chains` import and from the `configureChains` array.
- manually add the `polygonAmoy` related sections as seen below. The Amoy Polygon testnet is newer than the libraries this tutorial is using. Normally you'd search and replace testnet with a simple `amoy` value though instead we need to manually add.

Here is the complete `_app.tsx` with changes to use Amoy.

```tsx
import { getDefaultWallets, RainbowKitProvider } from "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit";
import "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { configureChains, createConfig, WagmiConfig } from "wagmi";
import { arbitrum, base, mainnet, optimism, polygon } from "wagmi/chains";
import { alchemyProvider } from "wagmi/providers/alchemy";
import { jsonRpcProvider } from "wagmi/providers/jsonRpc";
import "../styles/globals.css";

import { Chain } from "wagmi";

export const polygonAmoy = {
  id: 80002,
  name: "Polygon Amoy",
  network: "polygonamoy",
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: 18,
    name: "MATIC",
    symbol: "MATIC",
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    public: { http: ["https://polygon-amoy-bor-rpc.publicnode.com"] },
    default: { http: ["https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology"] },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    etherscan: { name: "OK LINK", url: "https://www.oklink.com/amoy" },
    default: { name: "OK LINK", url: "https://www.oklink.com/amoy" },
  },
  contracts: {
    multicall3: {
      address: "0xca11bde05977b3631167028862be2a173976ca11",
      blockCreated: 3127388,
    },
  },
} as const satisfies Chain;

const { chains, publicClient, webSocketPublicClient } = configureChains(
  [
    mainnet,
    polygon,
    optimism,
    arbitrum,
    base,
    ...(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS === "true"
      ? [polygonAmoy]
      : []),
  ],
  [
    alchemyProvider({ apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_ID || "" }),
    jsonRpcProvider({
      rpc: (chain) => ({
        http: `${chain.rpcUrls.default.http}`,
      }),
    }),
  ],
);

const { connectors } = getDefaultWallets({
  appName: "RainbowKit App",
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID || "",
  chains,
});

const wagmiConfig = createConfig({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors,
  publicClient,
  webSocketPublicClient,
});

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <WagmiConfig config={wagmiConfig}>
      <RainbowKitProvider chains={chains}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </RainbowKitProvider>
    </WagmiConfig>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

Now that we have our application setup, we can edit the Index Page.

<br />

---

### The Index Page

Notice that we are using the `page folder routing` in our app, which give us an
`index.tsx` page in the `/frontend/pages` directory. This file work as our
homepage at the root level, in our url will be `htpp://localhost:3000/` by
default.

We'll trim out most of the content in this initial file, and bring in a brand new `<TierNFT>` React component
that will house our main application functionality and will be displayed on the Home page.

We'll be able to identify the component in the `index.tsx` file by the following two sections:

```tsx
import { TierNFT } from "../components/tiernft";
```

```tsx
<main className={styles.main}>
  <TierNFT />
</main>
```

Open `frontend/pages/index.tsx`, remove most of the content, and update the file so that it looks like this:

```tsx
import type { NextPage } from "next";
import Head from "next/head";
import { TierNFT } from "../components/tiernft";
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css";

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <Head>
        <title>RainbowKit App</title>
        <meta
          content="Generated by @rainbow-me/create-rainbowkit"
          name="description"
        />
        <link href="/favicon.ico" rel="icon" />
      </Head>

      <main className={styles.main}>
        <TierNFT />
      </main>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

Before we can fire up the app for the first time, we need to create that `<TierNFT />`
component used above.

We'll be growing this component with our main application logic.

Let's create the folders to store these files:

```bash
cd frontend
mkdir components
mkdir hooks
```

Create `tiernft.tsx` inside the new `components` directory that will contain the following code:

```tsx
export function TierNFT() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>TierNFTs</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Running the Application

With this setup we can run the `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` command in our
console and click the returned link (`http://localhost:portnumber`) to preview
our application. This is a good way to debug and see if our code is behaving as
expected.

<Callout emoji="üí°">
  Make sure you are in the frontend directory before running the command.
</Callout>

The preview should look like this:

![App Header Preview](/assets/lessons/5/img_1.png)

### Overview of Application Structure

A well structured application is easy to maintain and debug when you split it into smaller components.
Each component is easier to understand and test.

In this application, we will have these files:

- `tiernft.tsx` - the main application logic which pulls in various components
- `nftcard.tsx` - a component that displays each NFT available to mint
- `minting.tsx` - a component that displays a message while minting
- `successfulmint.tsx` - a component that displays the final minted NFT and its details
- `useMint.ts` - logic that handles minting
- `useAwaitMintResult.ts` - logic that waits for the minting to complete to display the minted NFT

<Callout emoji="üí°">
  Each file is pasted in this lesson, though if you want to view the full
  project, is is available at
  [github.com/Developer-DAO/D_D-Academy-lesson-5-frontend-rainbowkit-starter](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/D_D-Academy-lesson-5-frontend-rainbowkit-starter).
</Callout>

### The TierNFT Component

We'll start with the main application logic, which is built as a React component.

Let's first stop our development server we had started running earlier, by pressing CTRL-C in terminal. Our code base won't be working correctly until we have all the code added. Or if you leave your server running, don't worry about any errors you see in your terminal, or errors you see in your browser until we've finished.

Add `tiernft.tsx` with the following code:

```tsx
import { ConnectButton } from "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit";
import Head from "next/head";
import { CSSProperties, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useAccount } from "wagmi";
import TierABI from "../artifacts/contracts/TierNFT.sol/TierNFT.json";
import { NftCard } from "./nftcard";
import { useAwaitMintResult } from "../hooks/useAwaitMintResult";
import { useMint } from "../hooks/useMint";
import { Minting } from "./minting";
import { SuccessfulMint } from "./successfulmint";

const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = process.env
  .NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS as `0x${string}`;

export function TierNFT() {
  const [isUserConnected, setIsUserConnected] = useState(false);
  const [modalShow, setModalShow] = useState(false);
  const [mintingPrice, setMintingPrice] = useState("0");

  // await for user to connect their wallet
  const { isConnected, address } = useAccount();
  useEffect(() => {
    try {
      setIsUserConnected(isConnected);
    } catch (e) {
      const error = e as Error;
      console.log("Error connecting to user", error.message);
    }
  }, [isConnected]);

  // mint when the mintingPrice is set
  const { mint, isMinting, txData } = useMint({
    contractAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    abi: TierABI.abi,
    mintingPrice: mintingPrice,
  });

  // start mint via setting mintingPrice
  useEffect(() => {
    if (mintingPrice !== "0" && mint) {
      mint()
        .then(() => {
          setModalShow(true);
        })
        .catch((e) => {
          setModalShow(false);
          const error = e as Error;
          console.log("Error minting NFT", error.message);
        })
        .finally(() => {
          setMintingPrice("0");
        });
    }
  }, [mintingPrice, mint]);

  // when mint completes, return the minted nft we want to show
  const { mintedTokenId, latestNFTMinted } = useAwaitMintResult({
    abi: TierABI.abi,
    contractAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    userWalletAddress: address,
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>NFT Minter</title>
        <meta

      <header style={header}>

        <ConnectButton />
        {!isUserConnected && (
          <div style={pleaseConnectWallet}>Please connect your wallet.</div>
        )}
      </header>

      {isUserConnected && (
        <main>
          <div style={NFTFlex}>

          {modalShow &&
            (txData ? (

                mintedTokenId={mintedTokenId}
                onClose={() => {
                  setModalShow(false);
                }}
                txData={txData}
              />
            ) : (
              <Minting />
            ))}
        </main>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

const header: CSSProperties = {
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: "column",
  alignItems: "center",
  justifyContent: "space-between",
};

const pleaseConnectWallet: CSSProperties = {
  marginTop: "20px",
};

const NFTFlex: CSSProperties = {
  display: "flex",
  alignItems: "center",
  justifyContent: "space-evenly",
  gap: "50px",
};
```

Let's break down the code next.

#### imports and primary pieces

At the top of the file we import the necessary dependencies for our application. This pulls in
the components we're about to add, plus existing libraries.

<Callout emoji="üí°">
  Here we start to use React Hooks, which are JavaScript functions that manage
  the state's behaviour and side effects by isolating them from a component.
</Callout>

- Two common hooks we use are `useEffect` and `useState`. More on
  [state](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-state-in-react-explained-with-examples/)
  and the
  [useEffect](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-useeffect-absolute-beginners/)
  hook.
- RainbowKit provides us a ready-made `ConnectButton`.
- We need to use the `useAccount` hook from WAGMI to check account connection
  and `useContractRead` and `useContractWrite` to interact with our smart
  contract. We will look into WAGMI and these hooks a little down the line.
  {/* I eventually wanna create a side-drawer for ABI */}
- `TierABI` is our contract's Application Binary Interface (ABI). The ABI helps
  us interact with the smart contract outside the blockchain or
  contract-to-contract. You can read more about ABIs
  [here](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/solidity/what-is-an-abi).
- The `viem` library will assist us with some utilities in our code.
- Once again, `useEffect` and `useState` are react hooks that will help us
  perform side effects and capture the state, respectively.

We're creating a default function called `TierNFT` that will render our mint workflow.
As you can see , we are required to add the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` which is
displayed in your command line when we deploy the contract. The `useAccount`
hook lets us access account data and check connection status. We will use this
as a check to provide access to the minting features of our app. `useState`
lets us store state information such as whether a user is connected.
The general syntax for using the `useState` hook is:

`const [variableName, functionToSetVariable] = useState(intialValue)`

<Callout emoji="üí°">
  The initial value also serves as the type for the value assigned. If the
  initial value is a string, then the values set later must be strings too. The
  hook can be created without an initial value as well but a good practice is to
  always choose and pass in an initial value based on the value type we expect
  to assign to that variable.
</Callout>

We will revisit these state variables later to see their implementation.

#### Walk through of the major components

Notice our file has some `//` comment lines. These are used to explain the code.
It's highlighting the various steps in the minting process.

- We start by checking if the user is connected to the wallet. If they are, we
  display the minting options. If not, we ask them to connect their wallet.
- Once user signs in, they see 3 NFT cards. Each card has a name, image and a
  mint button. We use `<NftCard />` component to display each card.
- When user clicks the mint button, we set the minting price and call the `mint`
  function from the `useMint` hook. `useMint` is a custom hook and demonstrates grouping
  related hooks together into a new component.
- Once the mint is underway, the application listen to the blockchain for the minting
  transaction to complete. We use the `useAwaitMintResult` hook to do this. It
  returns the `mintedTokenId` and `latestNFTMinted` that we can use to display
  the minted NFT and its details via our `<SuccessfulMint />` component.

### React Display Components

We have a few components that we need to create to complete our application. These are React components
that are used to display the minting process and the minted NFT. They don't have much logic in them
are are primarily used to display information passed in from the main application via component properties.

This allows us to reuse components (like the `NftCard` component) and keeps our `tiernft.tsx` code
clean by leveraging the power of React and its component-based architecture.

Let's just add three of them now and then we'll explain some common patterns.

**Create components/nftcard.tsx**

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";
import { CSSProperties } from "react";

export function NftCard({
  name,
  imageSrc,
  alt,
  onClick,
  disabled,
}: {
  name: string;
  imageSrc: string;
  alt: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  disabled: boolean;
}) {
  return (
    <div style={NFTCard}>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <Image src={imageSrc} width="200" height="200" alt={alt} />
      <button onClick={onClick} style={NFTMint} disabled={disabled}>
        Mint
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

const NFTCard: CSSProperties = {
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: "column",
  border: "2px solid white",
  borderRadius: "10px",
  padding: "20px",
  alignItems: "center",
  gap: "10px",
  fontWeight: "bold",
};

const NFTMint: CSSProperties = {
  fontWeight: "700",
  padding: "5px 20px",
  border: "2px solid white",
  color: "white",
  backgroundColor: "black",
  borderRadius: "5px",
  cursor: "pointer",
};
```

**Create components/minting.tsx**

```tsx
import { CSSProperties } from "react";

export function Minting() {
  return (
    <div style={modal}>
      <div style={modalContent}>
        <h2>Minting...</h2>
        <p>Please be patient, this make take several seconds.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

const modal: CSSProperties = {
  position: "fixed",
  left: "0",
  top: "0",
  right: "0",
  bottom: "0",
  backgroundColor: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)",
  display: "flex",
  alignItems: "center",
  justifyContent: "center",
  textAlign: "center",
  zIndex: "1",
};

const modalContent: CSSProperties = {
  backgroundColor: "#fff",
  padding: "10px 30px",
  borderRadius: "16px",
  color: "#000",
};
```

**Create components/successfulmint.tsx**

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";
import { CSSProperties } from "react";
import { TransactionReceipt, formatUnits } from "viem";
import { useNetwork } from "wagmi";

export function SuccessfulMint({
  contractAddress,
  nftMinted,
  mintedTokenId,
  txData,
  onClose,
}: {
  contractAddress: `0x${string}`;
  nftMinted: {
    name: string;
    image: string;
  };
  mintedTokenId?: bigint;
  txData?: TransactionReceipt;
  onClose: () => void;
}) {
  const { chain } = useNetwork();
  return (
    <div style={modal}>
      <div style={modalContent}>
        <div style={modalContent}>
          <h2>Mint Successful</h2>
          <div style={modalBody}>
            {nftMinted.name && <h3>{nftMinted.name}</h3>}
            {nftMinted.image && (
              <Image
                src={nftMinted.image}
                height="200"
                width="200"
                alt="Minted NFT"
              />
            )}
          </div>
          <div style={modalFooter}>
            <button style={modalButton}>
              {mintedTokenId != undefined && (
                <a
                  href={`https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/amoy/${contractAddress}/${formatUnits(
                    mintedTokenId,
                    0,
                  )}`}
                  target="_blank"
                >
                  View on OpenSea
                </a>
              )}
            </button>
            <button style={modalButton}>
              {txData && txData.transactionHash ? (
                <a
                  href={`${chain?.blockExplorers?.etherscan?.url}/tx/${txData.transactionHash}`}
                  target="_blank"
                >
                  View on Polygonscan
                </a>
              ) : undefined}
            </button>
            <button onClick={onClose} style={modalButton}>
              Close
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

const modal: CSSProperties = {
  position: "fixed",
  left: "0",
  top: "0",
  right: "0",
  bottom: "0",
  backgroundColor: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)",
  display: "flex",
  alignItems: "center",
  justifyContent: "center",
  textAlign: "center",
  zIndex: "1",
};

const modalContent: CSSProperties = {
  backgroundColor: "#fff",
  padding: "10px 30px",
  borderRadius: "16px",
  color: "#000",
};

const modalBody: CSSProperties = {
  padding: "20px",
  borderTop: "1px solid #eee",
  borderBottom: "1px solid #eee",
};

const modalFooter: CSSProperties = {
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: "column",
  gap: "10px",
  padding: "20px",
  justifyContent: "space-evenly",
};

const modalButton: CSSProperties = {
  padding: "10px 20px",
  backgroundColor: "#fff",
  color: "#666",
  border: "0",
  borderRadius: "10px",
  fontSize: "18px",
  fontWeight: "700",
  boxShadow:
    "0 0.2em 0.4em 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 0.3em 1em 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)",
  cursor: "pointer",
};
```

Here are some common patterns we can see in these components:

- they all use the `.tsx` extension which is a TypeScript file that contains JSX.
- each returns an `export function`. That function name is the React component's name.
- the function accepts an object of properties followed by `:{}` which are the TypeScript
  annotations for each property. TypeScript provides meaningful information for your code editor
  and provides warnings when you try to pass the wrong type of data to a component.

`SuccessfulMint` component has these properties and types, each explained below:

```tsx
: {
  contractAddress: `0x${string}`;
  nftMinted: {
    name: string;
    image: string;
  };
  mintedTokenId?: bigint;
  txData?: TransactionReceipt;
  onClose: () => void;
}
```

- `contractAddress` is a string that starts with `0x`.
- `nftMinted` is an object with a `name` and `image` property.
- `mintedTokenId` is a `bigint` type and is optional.
- `txData` is a `TransactionReceipt` type and is optional.
- `onClose` is a function that returns `void`.

TypeScript annotations don't end up in the final code, they are used while developing your application.

At the end of each file is the styling used by the component. This is a common pattern in React applications using CSS-in-JS styling.

### Images for the Three NFT Tiers

The `NftCard` component uses images to display the NFTs. We need to add these images to our application.

Create a new folder named `nfts` in the `/public` directory for saving Tier SVGs:

```bash
mkdir -p mkdir -p public/nfts
```

(`-p` option creates the parent `/public` folder as well)

You can find links for downloading the SVGs here:

- [0_basic.svg](https://arweave.net/o9z59y3sDvBaamvBDJGtyX5BGM983n1zwbs-UaZRUM8)
- [1_medium.svg](https://arweave.net/-sa-soe34iPLridK0T98rWb7XvfHRSTDdBCoXCuwv60)
- [2_premium.svg](https://arweave.net/AG0bE-GMrUh-7YjtxlY01woT7kbwEPwgREzuPptJZBo)

Save them with the same names as shown in the links above for smooth flow in the
code.

### Add Blockchain functionality

So far, we've been building a fairly standard React application in `Next.js` framework and have configured it
to use `RainbowKit` and `WAGMI` for wallet connections and blockchain interactions.

We haven't added any blockchain functionality to our application. We'll do that next.

WAGMI is a collection of React hooks that allows us to work effectively with Ethereum. We
need to use many of these hooks together to achieve our goal. Instead of sticking them all in one
big file, we created two custom hooks to handle the minting process.

The `useMint` hook is used to mint the NFTs. It takes in the contract address, ABI, and the minting
price. It returns a `mint` function that can be called to mint the NFTs.

The `useAwaitMintResult` hook is used to wait for the minting to complete. It takes in the ABI, contract
address, and the user's wallet address. It returns the `mintedTokenId` and `latestNFTMinted` that we can
use to display the minted NFT and its details via our `<SuccessfulMint />` component.

We'll be adding these hooks to our application next.

#### Create `useMint` hook

Let's start with the `useMint` hook. Let's create a `hooks/useMint.ts` file and add the following code:

```tsx
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import {
  useContractWrite,
  usePrepareContractWrite,
  useWaitForTransaction,
} from "wagmi";

export function useMint({
  abi,
  contractAddress,
  mintingPrice,
}: {
  abi: any;
  contractAddress: `0x${string}`;
  mintingPrice: string;
}) {
  const { config } = usePrepareContractWrite({
    address: contractAddress,
    abi: abi,
    functionName: "mint",
    value: parseEther(mintingPrice),
    onError: (e) => {
      console.log("Error minting NFT", e);
    },
    enabled: mintingPrice !== "0",
  });

  const {
    data: mintData,
    writeAsync: mint,
    isLoading: isMinting,
  } = useContractWrite(config);

  const { data: txData } = useWaitForTransaction({
    hash: mintData?.hash,
  });

  return {
    mint,
    mintData,
    isMinting,
    txData,
  };
}
```

What's happening in `useMint`?

To mint, we need a contact address to call, the contract ABI that has info about the blockchain
`mint` function, and the minting price.

We use the WAGMI `usePrepareContractWrite` hook to prepare the contract for writing
([wagmi docs](https://1.x.wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useContractWrite#prepared-usage)) that lets us pass
in the contract address, contract ABI and the function name to return a JavaScript function
(that we have called `mint`) that can interact with our smart contract and trigger writing to the
blockchain to mint our NFT. This hook returns a `config` object that we can use to mint the NFTs.
Here we pass in the amount of ETH we want to send (in the `value` parameter).

We then use the [`useContractWrite`](https://1.x.wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useContractWrite) hook from
WAGMI that accepts our `config` and then provides us our `mint` function.

It also returns some additional features for error handling and checking whether
the function is running or completed (`isMinting`). We are assigning well defined names to the
returned values for easily calling them later. For example, the `data` returned
is called `mintData`.

Our custom hook returns that `mintData` object that contains the transaction hash and the `mint` function.

We also use the `useWaitForTransaction` hook to wait for the minting transaction to complete. This
hook returns a `txData` object that contains the transaction receipt.
We'll explain `useWaitForTransaction` shortly.

At the end of the hook, you'll see it returns `{mint, mintData, isMinting, txData}` which are used
in the main application to update the UI and pass values to our `useAwaitMintResult` hook.

#### Create `useAwaitMintResult` hook

Let's add the `useAwaitMintResult` by creating `hooks/useAwaitMintResult.ts` file and adding
the following code:

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Log } from "viem";
import { useContractEvent, useContractRead } from "wagmi";

type LogWithArgs = Log & {
  args: { from: string; to: string; tokenId: bigint };
};

export function useAwaitMintResult({
  abi,
  contractAddress,
  userWalletAddress,
}: {
  abi: any;
  contractAddress: `0x${string}`;
  userWalletAddress?: `0x${string}`;
}) {
  const [mintedTokenId, setMintedTokenId] = useState<bigint | undefined>(
    undefined,
  );
  const [latestNFTMinted, setLatestNFTMinted] = useState<{
    name: string;
    image: string;
  }>({ name: "", image: "" });

  // await for mint to complete
  const unwatch = useContractEvent({
    address: contractAddress,
    abi: abi,
    eventName: "Transfer",
    listener(events) {
      if (events.length === 0) {
        return;
      }
      events.forEach((event) => {
        const extendedEvent = event as LogWithArgs;
        const { to, tokenId } = extendedEvent.args;
        if (to === userWalletAddress) {
          setMintedTokenId(tokenId);
          unwatch?.();
        }
      });
    },
  });

  const { data: tokenURI }: { data: any } = useContractRead({
    address: contractAddress,
    abi: abi,
    functionName: "tokenURI",
    args: [mintedTokenId],
    watch: true,
    enabled: mintedTokenId != undefined,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    try {
      if (tokenURI) {
        setLatestNFTMinted(
          JSON.parse(
            window.atob(tokenURI.substring(tokenURI.indexOf(",") + 1)),
          ),
        );
      }
    } catch (e) {
      const error = e as Error;
      console.log("Error fetching token URI", error.message);
    }
  }, [tokenURI]);

  return {
    mintedTokenId,
    latestNFTMinted,
  };
}
```

When a NFT successfully mints, an event is emitted from the smart contract. Our `useAwaitMintResult` hook
will listen for this event, so we can display the minted NFT in our final Successful Mint modal.

How does the hook listen for the mint event? Notice we're using WAGMI's `useContractEvent` hook.
We ask it to monitor the `Transfer` event for our NFT contract.

Yes, "hooks" all the way down. Hooks are often composed from other hooks.

If the blockchain is busy there can be many transfer events happening, so we wait until there is a
transaction that matches our wallet address and ignore the others. When the event we want comes in,
we'll then discover the tokenId of our freshly minted NFT.

Once we `setMintedTokenId(tokenId);` another WAGMI hook kicks off below called `useContractRead`.
We use this to retrieve the NFT's `tokenURI` which we'll parse to find the NFT's metadata, including
its name and image.

At the very end of the hook, we return the `mintedTokenId` and `latestNFTMinted` to the main application
in `tiernft.tsx`.

There are several steps involved, which is another reason why we created this hook. It keeps
the logic focused on the task at hand and makes it more obvious what inputs values the hook needs,
and what output values it is returning to the component using our hook.

### Let's Mint some test NFTs

Now our preview should look like this once a wallet is connected:

![NFT Cards Preview](/assets/lessons/5/img_2.png)

Try minting these NFTs and check your wallet's profile on `https://testnets.opensea.io/YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS`.

The final modal should look like similar to this:
